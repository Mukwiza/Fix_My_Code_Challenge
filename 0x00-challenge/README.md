INTRODUCTION:
----------------

This is FIx my code challenge, it will contain files whose codes are written incorrectly. My role is to fix each code in every file. So that programs run properly.

General requirements:
-----------------

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

REASON FOR THIS PROJECT:
-----------------------

Fix my code is a new type of project, where weâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!
Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.
Please download the repository 0x00-Fix-My-Code-Challenge and use it as initial files for all solutions.
You should not recode everything, just fix it!
